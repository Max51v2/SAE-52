            [Skyrim opens with an Imperial wagon driving four prisoners down a snowy mountain pass. All are seated and bound; the one dressed in finery is gagged.]
            <br><br>
            Ralof: Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
            <br><br>
            Lokir: D**n you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you, I could’ve stolen that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me — we should be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
            <br><br>
            Ralof: We’re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
            <br><br>
            Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!
            <br><br>
            [Lokir looks at the gagged man.]
            <br><br>
            Lokir: And what’s wrong with him?
            <br><br>
            Ralof: Watch your tongue! You’re speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.
            <br><br>
            Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You’re the leader of the rebellion. But if they captured you… Oh gods, where are they taking us?
            <br><br>
            Ralof: I don’t know where we’re going, but Sovngarde awaits.
            <br><br>
            Lokir: No, this can’t be happening. This isn’t happening.
            <br><br>
            Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?
            <br><br>
            Lokir: Why do you care?
            <br><br>
            Ralof: A Nord’s last thoughts should be of home.
            <br><br>
            Lokir: Rorikstead. I’m…I’m from Rorikstead.
            <br><br>
            [They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]
            <br><br>
            Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!
            <br><br>
            General Tullius: Good. Let’s get this over with.
            <br><br>
            Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.
            <br><br>
            Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. D**n elves. I bet they had something to do with this. This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny…when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.
            <br><br>
            [A man and son watch the prisoners pull into town.]
            <br><br>
            Haming: Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?
            <br><br>
            Torolf: You need to go inside, little cub.
            <br><br>
            Haming: Why? I want to watch the soldiers.
            <br><br>
            Torolf: Inside the house. Now.
